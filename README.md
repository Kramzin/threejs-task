# threejs-task

Tech stack:
ES6
Three.js
Html

Objective:

Part 1, creation:

In the upper right corner of the screen there will be 3 inputs:
Dropdown (select) to select geometry type (e.g. Cube, Sphere and Pyramid)
Numeric input for determining the size (scale) of the shape (mesh.scale.set(2,2,2))
Button "Create" - by clicking on which a 3D object with the selected geometry and size should be created, in any random place on the stage.

Part 2, deletion:

After creating the shape, its UUID (mesh.uuid, unique 3D object identifier) should appear in the list in the lower left corner of the page, there should be an “X” button to the right of the UUID, by clicking on which the shape should disappear from the scene.

Part 3, improvements:

There must be at least 1 light source on the stage
Add Orbit Controls for the ability to rotate, zoom
